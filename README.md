# American-Sign-Language-Detection-in-Real-Time
This project consists of four python files and helps in real-time detection of ASL words.

ASL detection using deep learning holds great promise for the future, offering efficient and accurate means of interpreting and understanding American Sign Language. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures, ASL detection systems can enable real-time communication between the deaf community and the hearing world. This technology has the potential to break down communication barriers, promote inclusivity, and empower individuals who rely on ASL as their primary means of communication, fostering greater accessibility and understanding in various domains of life.
